Abstract
--------

Crypt::Nettle provides a Perl interface to the libnettle cryptographic
functions.

------------
Requirements
------------

Crypt::Nettle requires that libnettle is installed on your system. You
can use your favourite package manager or download the latest version
of Nettle:

  http://www.lysator.liu.se/~nisse/nettle/

------------------
Basic Installation
------------------

Crypt::Nettle may be installed through the CPAN shell in
the usual manner.  Typically:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e 'install Crypt::Nettle'

You can also read this README from the CPAN shell:

  $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
  cpan> readme Crypt::Nettle

And you can install the component from the CPAN prompt as well:

  cpan> install Crypt::Nettle

-------------------
Manual Installation
-------------------

This module may also be installed manually.  Its distribution is
available from the author's CPAN directory,
<ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/D/DK/DKG/>, or a similarly
named directory at your favorite CPAN mirror.

Downloading and unpacking the distribution are left as exercises for
the reader.  To build and test it:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test

When you're ready to install the component:

  make install

It should now be ready to use.

Acknowledgements
----------------

Crypt::Nettle started off using Crypt::GCrypt as a template.  Thanks
very much to Alessandro Ranellucci for the guidance.  All mistakes are
my own, of course.

Thanks for reading!
