=head1 NAME

Crypt::Nettle - Perl interface to the Nettle Cryptographic library

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Crypt::Nettle;

=head1 ABSTRACT

Crypt::Nettle provides an object interface to the C nettle library. It
currently supports message digests (including HMAC), symmetric
encryption and decryption, pseudo-random number generation, and RSA
public-key crypto.

In the future, it should also support DSA for public-key signatures.

=head1 MESSAGE DIGESTS (HASH FUNCTIONS)

See Crypt::Nettle::Hash for digest functions and HMAC.

=head1 SYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION

See Crypt::Nettle::Cipher for symmetric encryption and decryption.

=head1 RANDOM NUMBER GENERATION

See Crypt::Nettle::Yarrow for a cryptographic random number generator.

=head1 ASYMMETRIC CRYPTOGRAPHY

The only public-key crypto algorithm supported by Crypt::Nettle at the
moment is RSA.  See Crypt::Nettle::RSA for details.

=head1 BUGS AND FEEDBACK

Crypt::Nettle has no known bugs, mostly because no one has reported
any. Please mail to the author (dkg@fifthhorseman.net) with your
contributions, comments, suggestions, bug reports or complaints.
